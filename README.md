## 🚀 Features

### 🛒 Ingredients & Shopping List

* **Smart Shopping List:**
  * Add what a recipe is missing in one tap; items already in your pantry are skipped.
  * Duplicates merge and amounts add up (250 gm + 100 gm = 350 gm, 500 ml + 1 l = 1.5 l).
  * Grouped by aisle, tick items off as you buy them, then move them into your pantry.
  * Copy the list or send it on WhatsApp.
* **Use-It-Up Tracker:**
  * Add an expiry date to any pantry item (quick presets, plus a typical shelf life for common foods).
  * Colour-coded badges show what is expired or about to expire.
  * A "Use these up soon" banner offers **Cook with these**: recipes are built around what is about to go off,
    and each recipe says which expiring items it uses up.
* **Manual Ingredient Entry:**
  * Users can add ingredients manually (e.g., "Tomatoes – 1kg" or "Onion – 2 nos.").
* **Ingredient Scanning:**
  * Scan grocery bags to update kitchen inventory using the camera.
* **Smart Suggestions on Entry:**
  * Autocomplete with quantity variants (e.g., Tomato (250g), Tomato (1kg)).
* **Auto-detect Bundled Items:**
  * Smart detection of common units like "2 nos." and grams.
